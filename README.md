# myHTMLlib
My personal library when working with HTML sites

First the [Bootstrap Library](https://github.com/theRealProHacker/myHTMLlib/tree/main/Bootstrap). It is easy to use and handy, has a good documentation and fits its name perfectly. This is actually Bootstrap 5.0.0   
The documentation is here:  
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/  
The official GitHub page:  
https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap  

The next one is [jQuery](https://github.com/theRealProHacker/myHTMLlib/tree/main/jquery). VanillaScript and jQuery are mmaybe the best combination for client side programming.

[Official GitHub](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)  

More unknown is the [bootstrap-slider lib](https://github.com/theRealProHacker/myHTMLlib/tree/main/bootstrap-slider) by @seiyria.  
Find it on Github [here](https://github.com/seiyria/bootstrap-slider)  
But if you want to use it you have to read [this](https://seiyria.com/bootstrap-slider/)  

I personally like the bootstrap-slider library more than the [NoUislider library](https://github.com/theRealProHacker/myHTMLlib/tree/main/NoUislider/) but I still want to include it here because it is a basic lib for sliders.

The [last one](https://github.com/theRealProHacker/myHTMLlib/tree/main/Arc) right now is not even a library but just a single file with a single function with a single purpose:  
To make drawing arcs with SVG easy as ever. Especially for moving or reactive arcs it is almost impossible to draw the SVG arc in an easy way. But in this function you just have to pass the centerpoint, the x- and y-radius, the start angle, the sweep, and the rotation to receive an arc path that you can draw. 
This code is from [Xah Lee](http://xahlee.info/js/svg_circle_arc.html)

There are more detailed README-files in the single directories.
Good luck!
